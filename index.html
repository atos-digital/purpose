            <ul>
              <li>
                Coding starts and ends with the business. Sit with the business.
                Understand the business problem. Eventually help implement the
                business change. Challenge everything, you dont have to be a
                business expert
              </li>
              <li>
                Squads have delegated responsibility, reject command and
                control. Reject layers of admin and management
              </li>
              <li>
                Squads are trusted to solve the business problem. No need to
                checkup on people. They will ask for help if they need it
              </li>

              <li>
                Focus on meaninful and deep work, avoid repetitive low value
                work like powerpoint and xls
              </li>

              </li>
              <li>
                Invest in writing knowledge articles. Its better to write once
                read many, than waste developer time to explain things again and
                again
              </li>
              <li>Link to good resources, don't reinvent the wheel</li>

            <h2>NHS Longivety</h2>
            <h4>Twenty five more years of free at the point of use</h4>
            <p>
              IT has brought significant efficiencies to the industries that
              have embraced it. If applied correctly to the NHS, we could save
              billions of pounds that could be spent on patient care. The NHS
              was founded on the principles of universal, equitable,
              comprehensive, high quality, free at the point of delivery
              healthcare. It recently celebrated its 75th birthday and we think
              modern IT is at the heart of helping it get to 100 years with
              these principles in tact.

            <h2>Productivity vs aging population</h2>
            <h4>Tackling the demographic crisis</h4>
            <p>
              Population in the UK will decline, as it will in many western
              nations and even in places like China. If per capita GDP increase
              is less than the decrease in total population it follows that a
              country would experience a decline in GDP, known as an economic
              recession. If these conditions become permanent, the country could
              find itself in a permanent recession*. We can use a system of
              management that cuts out administration, together with AI tools,
              to increate the economic produtivity of individuals to compensate
              for population decline. Teams everywhere need to become 10% more
              economically productive.

            <h2>Unblocking digital transformation</h2>
            <h4>Quickily and cheaply replacing legacy systems</h4>
            <p>
              Digital Transformation is a business transformation in which we
              comprehensively integrate digital technologies into front-office,
              production, and back-office of business. Traditional enterprises
              are being held back from true digital transforamtion by legacy
              systems. We can quickily and cheaply rewrite legacy systems,
              brining cloud native, evergreen, zero ops applications to the
              enterprise.
